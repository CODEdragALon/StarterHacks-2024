# StarterHacks-2024

## Inspiration
As Canadians, we've always been concerned with the proliferation of wildfires across our nation. So we decided to create a tool that empowers all of us to protect ourselves from wildfires.
## What it does
FireTracker will get the current user's location and then display their location on a map. Everywhere there's a pin? That's a wildfire.
## How we built it
We used Leaflet to make our map, Bootstrap for styling and the plugin leaflet-geoseach for the search tool.
## Challenges we ran into
We had a lot of trouble adding the markers to the map.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
This is the first time we've used JavaScript in a website.
## What we learned
How to use a javascript library, add a script to a website, and use a frontend library.
## What's next for FireTracker
We'll continue to improve our website.
